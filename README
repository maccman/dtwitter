Beginnings of an idea for a distributed Twitter.

Alpha code - not in a working state.

The major issue at the moment is the distributed namespace - matching up @maccman to alex@madebymany.co.uk - and making sure @maccman is unique across the whole system. Let me know if you can think of a solution ;)
